> Petra's Assorted, Useful Collection of Assistance Library

Library mod for my mods, and a centralized place for tracking contributors and friends.

Also adds a little bit of content: shift-rightclicking a player with an empty hand will give them headpats!

## API

This mod is hosted at [BlameJared Maven](https://maven.blamejared.com/at/petra-k/paucal/). The most recent versions go
in the `paucal-{platform}-{minecraft version}` folders. (Sorry about all the messy folders everywhere; I am not the best
at Maven.)

---

This project uses [NightConfig](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/Night-Config), included with the PAUCAL jar
using [black, shadow magic](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow).
