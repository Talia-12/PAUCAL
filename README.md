Petrak@'s Assorted, Useful Collection of Assistance Library.

This is my library mod. It adds a bunch of useful backend utilities and serves as a central location to store all the
contributors to my mod (and has an API to query them!)

Also, adds headpatting! Shift-right-click another player with an empty hand to pat them. (You can disable this in the
config if you like.)

On Forge, PAUCAL has no dependencies. On Fabric, it requires the Fabric API and Cloth Config.

## API

This mod is hosted at [BlameJared Maven](https://maven.blamejared.com/at/petra-k/paucal/). The most recent versions go
in the `paucal-{platform}-{minecraft version}` folders. (Sorry about all the messy folders everywhere; I am not the best
at Maven.)

---

This project uses [Jankson](https://github.com/falkreon/Jankson), included with the PAUCAL jar
using [black, shadow magic](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow).
